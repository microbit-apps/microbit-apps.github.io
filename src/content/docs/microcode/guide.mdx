## The emotion badge program

The MicroCode home page (above, left) has three selectable tiles
for editing the current program, selecting from a sample of programs
(including the empty program), and recovering a program previously
saved in one of three slots. 

Selecting the edit tile with the A button on the display-shield
the very first time will open the sample `emotion badge` program
in the MicroCode editor (above, right). 

As both the display shield and micro:bits have A and B buttons, 
we will use `d-A` and `d-B` to refer to the shield's buttons
and `m-A` and `m-B` to refer to the micro:bit's buttons. Note
that the micro:bit buttons have triangular labels next to them.

### Reading the program

The program consists of four **When-Do** rules:

- the **When** section is the left side of the rule and describes an event.
- the **Do** section is the right side of the rule and describes an action to perform. 

The first two rules fire on the press of the m-A button.
The second two rules fire on the press of the m-B button.
The first and third rules display animations of happy and sad faces.
The second and fourth rules play happy and sad sounds.

### Running the program

You can run the program in one of three ways:

- use the direction pad to navigate to the green play tile and press `d-A`
- press either the `m-A` or `m-B` button on the micro:bit
- press the `menu` button on the display shield

The micro:bit will indicate the program is running by a quick circular
animation on the LED display.

### Stopping the program

The program will continue to run until

- you move to and select the stop tile (to the right of the play tile), or
- you edit the program

### Running without the display shield

If you remove the micro:bit from the shield and power it via battery or
USB, the last program you edited in MicroCode will begin to run.
