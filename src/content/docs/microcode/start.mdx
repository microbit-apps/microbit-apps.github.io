## What is MicroCode?

MicroCode provides an intuitive interface for programming your micro:bit with:
- Visual tile-based programming with tooltips
- Immediate execution on the micro:bit
- Three slots for saving programs

## Getting Started

- [Open MicroCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/#pub:67966-39882-94798-31344) in
a web browser. 
- Explore MicroCode via the simulator. Click on the full-screen icon in the simulator to 
  get the best experience. 
- After bringing focus to the display shield simulator, use the arrow 
  keys to navigate, the A key to select and the B key to back up.
- Download the code to your micro:bit by clicking the "Download" button in the MakeCode editor
and follow the instructions on how to copy MicroCode onto your micro:bit.
- [See the display shield instructions](/resources/display-shield-ui)

## The MicroCode home page

The MicroCode home page (above) has three selectable tiles
for editing the current program, selecting from a sample of programs
(including the empty program), and recovering a program previously
saved in one of three slots. 

Selecting the edit tile with the A button on the display-shield
the very first time will open the sample `emotion badge` program
in the MicroCode editor.  If you have already created 
a program select the samples tile and find the `emotion badge`
program there (as well as the empty program).

As both the display shield and micro:bits have A and B buttons, 
we will use `d-A` and `d-B` to refer to the shield's buttons
and `m-A` and `m-B` to refer to the micro:bit's buttons. Note
that the micro:bit buttons have triangular labels next to them:.

When running, the emotion badge program displays a happy animation and 
sound when the `m-A` button is pressed and a sad animation and 
sound when the `m-B` button is pressed.
