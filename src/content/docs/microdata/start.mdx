MicroData is a comprehensive data collection and analysis platform designed for the BBC micro:bit.

## What is MicroData?

MicroData provides tools for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing sensor data from your micro:bit with:

- Real-time data streaming and visualization
- Multi-sensor support
- Data analysis capabilities

## Getting Started

- [Open MicroData](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/#pub:95125-24885-94306-07135) in
a web browser. 
- Explore MicroData via the simulator. Click on the full-screen icon in the simulator to 
  get the best experience.
- After bringing focus to the display shield simulator, use the arrow 
  keys to navigate, the A key to select and the B key to back up.
- Download the code to your micro:bit by clicking the "Download" button in the MakeCode editor
and following instructions on how to copy MicroData onto your micro:bit.
- [See the display shield instructions](../display-shield-ui)

## Working with the display shield

Once you have downloaded the app to your micro:bit, plug it into the display shield.
See the [display shield overview](/getting-started/display-shields/) to see how
the micro:bit fits into the shield.

Most display shields have a built-in battery. Turn on the power switch on the display 
shield to power both the shield and the micro:bit.

You can also power the micro:bit and shield directly via USB plugged into the micro:bit
or the display shield.
