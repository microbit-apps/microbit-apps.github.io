## A and B button confusion

It is unfortunate that the micro:bit and the display shield both have
their own A and B buttons.  We will distinguish the buttons in the
documentation here as follows:

- we will use `d-A` and `d-B` to refer to the A and B buttons on the display shield
- we will use `m-A` and `m-B` to refer to the A and B buttons on the micro:bit
