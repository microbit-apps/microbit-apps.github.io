## What is MicroCode?

MicroCode provides an intuitive interface for programming your micro:bit with:
- Visual tile-based programming with tooltips
- Immediate execution on the micro:bit
- Three slots for saving programs

## Getting Started

- [Open MicroCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/#pub:67966-39882-94798-31344) in
a web browser. 
- Explore MicroCode via the simulator. Click on the full-screen icon in the simulator to 
  get the best experience.
- Download the code to your micro:bit by clicking the "Download" button in the MakeCode editor
and following instructions on how to copy MicroCode onto your micro:bit.

## Working with the display shield

Once you have downloaded the app to your micro:bit, plug it into the display shield.
See the [display shield overview](/getting-started/display-shields/) to see how
the micro:bit fits into the shield.

Most display shields have a built-in battery. Turn on the power switch on the display 
shield to power both the shield and the micro:bit.

You can also power the micro:bit and shield directly via USB plugged into the micro:bit
or the display shield.
