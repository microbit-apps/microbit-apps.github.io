Microbit Robot is a robotics framework that lets you build and control your own robots using the BBC micro:bit.

## What is Microbit Robot?

Transform your micro:bit into the brain of your own robot! With Microbit Robot, you can:
- Control motors and servos
- Read sensor data
- Build autonomous robots
- Create line-following vehicles
- Implement obstacle avoidance

## Getting Started

1. Assemble your robot according to the hardware guide
2. Program your robot using the Microbit Robot library
3. Test your code on your micro:bit
4. Refine and improve your robot's behavior

## Example Code

```python
from microbit import *
from microbit_robot import *

robot = Robot()

# Move forward
robot.move_forward()
sleep(1000)

# Turn right
robot.turn_right()
sleep(500)
```
