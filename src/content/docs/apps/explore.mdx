Follow these steps to explore and get set up with micro:bit applications.

1. [Open MicroCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/#pub:67966-39882-94798-31344). 
2. [Open MicroData](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta/#pub:95125-24885-94306-07135). 

Click on the full-screen icon in the simulator to get the best experience.
Download the code to your micro:bit by clicking the "Download" button in the MakeCode editor.

## Working with the display shield

Once you have downloaded the app to your micro:bit, plug it into the display shield.
See the [display shield overview](/getting-started/display-shields/) to see how
the micro:bit fits into the shield.

Most display shields have a built-in battery. Turn on the power switch on the display 
shield to power both the shield and the micro:bit.

You can also power the micro:bit and shield directly via USB plugged into the micro:bit
or the display shield.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues:
- Make sure your USB cable supports data transfer (some cables only charge)
- Try using a different USB port
- File an issue on the [micro:bit apps GitHub repository](https://github.com/microbit-apps/issues/issues)
