Follow these steps to explore and get set up with micro:bit applications.

## Software and Simulator Experience

1. Visit [https://makecode.microbit.org/beta](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta)
2. Click on the "Import" button on the right side of the page and select "Import URL"
3. Enter the URL of the micro:bit app you want to try
   - for MicroCode use: https://github.com/microbit-apps/microcode-v2
   - for MicroData use: https://github.com/microbit-apps/microdata
4. Use the simulator to explore the app features
5. When ready, click "Download" to get the hexfile to copy to your micro:bit

## Download hexfiles instead

If you prefer to skip the simulator, you can directly download the hexfiles:

- [MicroData](https://microbit-apps.github.io/microdata/microdata)
